# My First Site 🌐✨

> 🚀 **Fun Fact**: This was my *very first* step into the world of web development! From zero HTML knowledge to getting something on screen — this project marks the start of my dev journey. 😄

Welcome to **My First Site**, a simple static website built using just HTML and CSS. It's a basic yet meaningful project that kickstarted my learning in front-end development and helped me understand how the web actually works.

## 🔍 Overview

This website includes:

- A homepage with a welcome message
- About section describing the purpose
- Static contact form
- Basic CSS styling for layout and visuals

It's minimal, but it got me excited about coding websites — and that's what matters most.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
